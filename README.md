# CodeClause_Personality-Prediction-System-via-CV-Analysis

The Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis project aims to develop a system that can predict the personality of a person based on their CV or resume. This could be useful for a variety of purposes, such as helping recruiters to shortlist candidates for job interviews or helping individuals to choose a career path that is well-suited to their personality.
